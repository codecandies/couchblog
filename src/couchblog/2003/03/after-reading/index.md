… the [truth about Bowling for Columbine](http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html "Truth about Bowling for Columbine") I’m sure again, that you can never be sure what is the truth or what truth in all means. Is this true or that, is this propaganda or that, who is behind it and whom does it help? You can’t believe anything, not in the paper, not on the screen, the blogs, the net. Believe what you see and laugh about the rest. This is not a problem of war, it’s always the case. And if you can’t laugh about it: someone who comes and wants to tell **the** truth, don’t trust him at all. Me enclosed.
