[MT Extensions: Custom Dynamic Pages](http://www.nonplus.net/software/mt/CustomDynamicPages.htm "MT Extensions: Custom Dynamic Pages"):

> MovableType 2.6 ships with a new cgi, called mt-view.cgi, which allows you to dynamically build a page (as opposed to the statical pages that MT creates when it rebuilts an entry). This is similar to how pages are generated using the seach and comment listing CGIs. The mt-view.cgi is not yet officially supported and thus its usage is subject to change. However, it is very useful when you only occasionally need a page and don’t want to store it statically on the server.

Looks like MT is turning to offer an engine that dynamically produces pages. After implementing MySQL the next step to an MT, where you can choose between static and dynamic content?

It’s not ready yet, but you can use it now for instance to build dynamically produced print-pages.
