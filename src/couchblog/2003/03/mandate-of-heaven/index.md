[Scott Rosenberg:](http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2003/03/19.html "Scott Rosenberg's Links & Comment")

> Instead we have a leader who behaves like he has the Mandate of Heaven. Rather than reaching out to those who oppose him, both at home and abroad, he and his lieutenants choose to thumb their noses at their allies (»old Europe,« etc.) and paint their political opponents as traitors. This would be bad behavior in any president; in one who attained office under such clouded circumstances it is inexcusable.
