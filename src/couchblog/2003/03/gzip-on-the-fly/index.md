Also irgendwie fühle ich mich ein wenig ertappt:

> So your page is now totally pimped out. You have gads of content on your sidebar, you’ve used ScriptyGoddess know-how to have comments and extended entries pop out like magic, and you even have some entries to take up some space between all the gadgets. The problem? The code on your page is now weighing in at half a meg and you can actually hear people cry when they load your site with a modem.
