Ok all you live-linux-cd-friends, after gaming around with [Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html) (_note: visit on Cebit, 11/D42-21b…_), here is another hit: [Morphix](http://am.xs4all.nl/drupal/node.php?id=20 "Morphix - your imagination is the limit - Alextreme's Personal Place of Mayhem and utter Chaos"), another modular debian distro / package with the live-cd capability.

> Morphix is a modular distribution, with live-cd support and without any configuration (you burn the CD, you put it in your CD-Rom drive, you boot and it works… out of the box)

But morphix can do more than knoppix, cause it’s based on modules: there are packages for download with different strategies: Morphix Base, with KDE 3.1, with Gnome 2.2 and so on. Looks great. On the testing list at once.

Beside the website, there is a [mailinglist](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/morphix-user), too.
