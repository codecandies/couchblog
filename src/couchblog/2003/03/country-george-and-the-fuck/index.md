After the speech of George W. Bush tonight, he was found on the toilet of the oval office, whistling this little song:

Gimme a _B…_
Gimme an _U…_
Gimme a _S…_
Gimme a _H…_

What’s that spell?
What’s that spell?
What’s that spell?
What’s that spell?
What’s that spell?

yeah, c’mon on all you big strong men
[Uncle Sam](http://home.nycap.rr.com/content/us_poster_l.jpg) needs your help again
he’s got himself in a terrible jam
way down yonder _against [Saddam](http://www.rasscass.com/templ/te_bio.php?PID=391&RID=1)_
so put down your books and pick up a gun
we’re gonna have a whole lot of fun

and it’s 1, 2, 3, what’re we fighting for?
don’t ask me, I don’t give a damn
_within 48 hours we’ll kill Saddam_
and it’s 5, 6, 7, open up the pearly gates
ah, ain’t no time to wonder why
whoopee! we’re all gonna die

well c’mon generals, let’s move fast
your big chance has come at last
_fuck on what the [weasels said](http://www.zum.de/Faecher/G/BW/abbl/usa/bewert1.htm)_
the only [good _Arab_](http://www.gruene-berlin.de/wirtschaft/papiere/Gotteskrieger.htm) is one who’s dead
and you know that peace can only be won when we’ve blown ‘em all to kingdom come

chorus

well c’mon on [Wall Street](http://nachrichten.boerse.de/anzeige.php3?id=5892c54f)
don’t be slow
ring the bell for the go-go-go
there’s plenty [good money to be made](http://www.ftd.de/ub/in/1034763884781.html?nv=tn-rs)
by supplin’ the Army with the tools of the trade
just hope and pray that if we drop the [bomb](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/wnt/World/newbomb030225.html)
they drop it on Saddam

chorus

well c’mon mothers throughout this land
pack your boys off to _[Iraq](http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/iz.html)uiland_
c’mon pops, don’t hesitate
send ‘em off before it’s too late
be the first one on your block to have your boy come home [in a box](http://www.todiefor.biz/bodybagorderform.htm "Body Bag Order Form")

and it’s 1, 2, 3, what’re we fighting for?
[don’t ask me](http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/03/17/sprj.irq.antiwar.protests/index.html), I don’t give a damn

Originally from [Country Joe and the fish](http://www.well.com/~cjfish/), on good old Woodstock Festival, changes _are marked_ (just a few)…
