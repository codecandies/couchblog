Wow, I love this [Classic Cafes: London’s greatest 50s & 60s vintage formica cafes!](http://www.classiccafes.co.uk/ "Classic Cafes: London's greatest 50s & 60s vintage formica cafes!") site (Link via: [The Cartoonist](http://radio.weblogs.com/0113064/2003/04/02.html#a1098 "The Cartoonist")). Seems like not only Vienna is the town of coffeehouses! Must take a tour when visiting London (which will happen… err… who knows). If your visiting London on the other hand, you can be sure to be observed ‘round the clock, [visit Haiko Hebig](http://www.hebig.org/blogs/archives/main/000935.php "hebig.org/blog") for some evidences.

np: [Kate Bush - Coffee Homeground](http://www.purelyrics.com/index.php?lyrics=xuroqzsi "pureLyrics") (uhh, I like the german passage at the end, Kate Bush really speaks the sexiest german ever…)
