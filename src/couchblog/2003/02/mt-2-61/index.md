**HAHA!** This time I was right! My lazyness prevented me from updating to MT 2.6 this weekend and there it is: [Movable Type 2.61](http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_02.shtml#000787 "movabletype.org: News"). There were some bugs in it I guess. Am I right when I remember the same thing happening with version 2.5 / 2.51? OK, now I can make the update. If the site is gone within the next 20 minutes, I did something wrongâ€¦

**Later:** Still there! Seems to work.
