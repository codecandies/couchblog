Wow. Don’t know if there really is a blogging community (or several) but **there is** a Movable-Type-Community obviously! Otherwise sites like this [MT Plugin Directory](http://mt-plugins.org/ "MT Plugin Directory") would not be possible. Seems to me like starting to be a plugin-programmer for MT could be the right investment for the future… someday they will make money with it for sure.
