Haven’t heard of David Bowie for years? Maybe he’s one of the artists that doesn’t need the money to jump on the 80’s revival train, that’s good. A different side of Bowie is presented on [The Artwork of David Bowie](http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Othermedia/Artwork/index.html "The Artwork of David Bowie"), paintings and sculptures by Mr. Bowie, very interesting… maybe he should write some music again?
