I discovered some (minor) anoying bugs in the latest Mozilla version (1.3beta), does someone also detected this and has some hints? I can’t find anything over at [Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/)…

- The ‘Accept Cookie? Windows’ sometimes (not always) open in the wrong size, it is cut off on the right, sometimes the ‘no’-button isn’t reachable…
- On sites with extensive use of javascript a message ‘The document contains no data’ pops up (e.g. at ebay.de) but the document is displayed normal (so it contains data surely)…

Seen on Windows XP / Mozilla 1.3beta / Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.3b) Gecko/20030210
