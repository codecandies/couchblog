With [Googlert](http://www.googlert.com/ "Googlert") and your Google Web API License Key (get one [here](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount?continue=http://api.google.com/createkey&followup=http://api.google.com/createkey "Google Account")), you can track new search results for searches you specify. Can be helpful, if you often do the same searches and want to be informed if something new is added.
