Call my stupid, but I never understood the socalled ‘Box-Model-Hack’ which can help IE5.xyz to understand your widths in computed in your CSS. Ok, it was always commented but something in this commentary wasn:t understandable to me (_you know, english is not my mothertalk_), so I avoided to use it. Sure this led always to problems with my layouts, IE and CSS.

This morning I was enlighted. [Jonathon Delacour](http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000819.html "Jonathon Delacour: Is it better now?") has redesigned his site recently and dropped this nice link about the [simplified box model hack](http://www.doxdesk.com/personal/posts/css/20020212-bmh.html "and.doxdesk.com: personal: posts"), behind I found a nice and clear explanation of what is happeing. The text is about a year old but it helped. Thanks for that.

_OK, if I had revisited the box-model-hack-thing lately, after learning some programming languages, I would now have understand what ‘escaping’ means, but a year ago I didn’t. Ping._
