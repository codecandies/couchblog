I’m blogging with [movable type](http://www.movabletpye.org "MT Home") constantly since [May 12, 2002](http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2002/05/back_on_the_streets.php "couchblog: back on the streets"), that’s about **238 days**. I didn’t blogged **35 days**, so my »blogquote« (har har) was **72%**. Sorry, my self-setted-blog-plan-target of 99% wasn’t reached. Bad boy. ;-)

I wish I had saved my sunlog-archives.… good night.
