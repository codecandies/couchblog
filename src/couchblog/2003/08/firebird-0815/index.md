If you’re using/testing nightly builds of Firebird 0.61+/Linux, go and [get this 08-15-trunk-i686-linux-gtk2+xft-build](ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firebird/nightly/2003-08-15-10-trunk/ "Index of ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firebird/nightly/2003-08-15-10-trunk") for several reasons:

- Annoying errors fixed (surprisingly shutdowns when e.g. clicking submit buttons)
- Flash Plugin problems fixed
- great trunk title from the release date: this is 08/15-Firebird!

In Germany ‘08/15’ stands for something really simple, normal and boring or repeatly done. This may come from the famous german worldwar-novel-triology “08/15” by [Hans Hellmut Kirst (1914-1989)](http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/KirstHans/), or not, but it’s widely used anyway. Besides that: my self-hacked MovableType-Version used here, indentifies itself as “MT Version 2.620815” ;-)
