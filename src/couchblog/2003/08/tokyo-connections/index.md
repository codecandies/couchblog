> tadaaa. thanx to mfop2 even dummies like me are now able to moblog. still, i’m not really satisfied yet… so while trying to set up mfop2 i also e-mailed nico from \[[couchblog.de](http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/)\] asking for tech-help. neat, eh? just because you’ve got a neat looking blog - and a couple of smart sounding links with words like php and rss in them - you get annoyed by strangers asking you to help them, because they (err.. that would be me then) can’t tell tell unix from perl, or whatever..

I recently surfed after some moblogging details and I guess (apart from my statements before) this moblogging stuff is really interesting. Maybe that’s because I’m just one month away of getting a new cellphone from my provider which surely will be able to make these neat little shots…
