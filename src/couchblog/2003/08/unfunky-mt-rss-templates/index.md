[Horst Prillinger](http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/) states that he don’t want to take a part in the “RSS\-Wars”, but on the other hand…

So for all, who wants them MT to write full unfunky Winer-compliant RSS-Feeds (the original templates aren’t), can visit this [article @ The Aardvark Speaks](http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/archives/2003/08/index.html#000104 "The Aardvark Speaks: August 2003 Archives") and finds four different templates to copy and paste into Movable Type.
