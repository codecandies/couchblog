Believe it or not, [Adam Kalsey](http://kalsey.com/blog/)’s kids (7 and 8 years old) have an [e-commerce-site](http://popcorn.kalsey.com/ "Cub Scout Popcorn"), selling popcorn for their _Cub Scout Pack to pay for things like camping, outings, and Pinewood Derby._ That’s some kind of fun but makes me think about youth in general in the future a bit…
