[There](http://www.mozilla.org/website-beta/ "mozilla - home of the mozilla, firebird, and camino web browsers") is the beta version of [mozilla.org](http://www.mozilla.org)s new “end user website”. I would give them a loud “hmmm”, not my style at least, but very usable in the end, I guess. When you go there, don’t forget to load latest [Mozilla 1.5](http://www.mozilla.org/website-beta/mozilla1.x/) ;-).

**Later:** You could get your new [Firebird 0.7 here](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/), if not the server wasn’t down. BTW, the firebird website is totally ugly ugly ugly! Err, just my 2p.
