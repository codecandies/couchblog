For god’s sake, Rolling Stone tickers: [“Death” Becomes Cypress Hill](http://www.rollingstone.com/News/newsarticle.asp?nid=18881&afl=rss) again! Yes! Good decision!

> After delving heavily into hard rock on their past two releases, Cypress Hill are going back to straight-up hip-hop on their upcoming seventh album, Till Death Do Us Part, due in March.

Can’t await that new album. Meanwhile visit [cypresshill.com](http://www.cypresshill.com/)
