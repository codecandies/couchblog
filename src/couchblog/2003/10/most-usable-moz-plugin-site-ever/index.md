Hey, this should be named “really phatt”: [Pike’s Mozilla Firebird Extensions](http://www.pikey.me.uk/mozilla/). A site with (in the moment) eight usefully firebird extensions. Ok, that’s cool but not the clue at all: you can check more than obe extension for downloading and installation at once. And you can press “install to browser” or “install to profile”, and it does right this: installing more than one extension at a time. Cool.

The [firebird extension site](http://texturizer.net/firebird/extensions/) should be like this, that would save time. Oh yes.
