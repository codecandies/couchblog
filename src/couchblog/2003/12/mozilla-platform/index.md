> In 2010 we’ll look back and say 2003 was the year that Mozilla really began. Mozilla-based products have attracted many flattering reviews and several industry awards this year. At the same time, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Outlook Express, which are Mozilla’s most obvious competitors, are moribund at best. At worst, they’re buggy, security compromised and virtually abandoned by Microsoft.
