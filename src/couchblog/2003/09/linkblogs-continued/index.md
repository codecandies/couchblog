Short one-line-blogging of interesting links gets more and more in fashion. Some present their links between their “longer entries” (like [Papa Scott does](http://www.papascott.de)) others are collecting links for an own link directory (like [me](http://www.couchblog.de/links/)) and third do “sidebar-blogging”. A nice howto for MT\-Users can be found at [paranoidfish.org](http://www.paranoidfish.org/notes/2003/08/30/1756 "paranoidfish.org/notes/ : Link log howtos").
