From [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/06/02/1213231) we’re send to an [article in India Times](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/html/uncomp/articleshow?msid=2213 "The Times Of India: IBM launches India's first Linux desktop") where we learn that there is an IBM NetVista A30 Linux Desktop sold in some Indian cities, priced at about $850. Seems that there are other markets to enter besides our windows contaminated western world. Here in Germany the hardware discounter [Vobis](http://www1.vobis.de/) is actually [selling a linux box](http://web.vobis.de/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/de/-/EUR/DisplayProductInformation-Short;sid=YOronpDaOEzonq4BAfYxx_a-QtCcHsn-lok=?ProductSKU=160309 "PC Vobis Basic Linux") bundeled with SuSE 8.1 on a AMD Duron 1300 256 MB RAM for EUR 399,–.

If you’re considering about using linux, [linuxbeginner.org](http://www.linuxbeginner.org/) may be the place to visit, there is a nice article about the [pros and cons](http://www.linuxbeginner.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=104&mode=flat&order=1&thold=0 "linuxbeginner.org: Why run linux") of using linux.

Meanwhile [apache.org: Apache 2.0.46 Released](http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Announcement2.html): Version 2.0.46 was relased for fixing some security issues. And for those who mix linux and windows (like me) here is an essential tutorial: [Using Samba to share printers](http://www.linux-sxs.org/networking/samba_printers.html "linuxSXS").
