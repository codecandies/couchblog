[This part on PCLinuxOnline](http://www.pclinuxonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=7015 "PCLinuxOnline - Ximian Desktop on Suse 8.2 my review") says that the new Ximian Desktop is on SuSE 8.2 _»buggy as a YUGO car«_. Bugs, no YAST\-Menu and no shutdown procedure. Can someone proove this? Sad.
