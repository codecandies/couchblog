[The Aardvark Speaks :: Horst Prillinger:](http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/2003/06/23.html#a2120 "The Aardvark Speaks :: Horst Prillinger's weblog")

> Why? Because the mail and blog entries contain real names and telephone numbers, and this is a strict no-no. Even if the child is real and the story is real, and no matter how desperate the parents are, you do never, repeat, NEVER forward any e-mails or blog entries containing addresses or phone numbers of people whom you haven’t personally spoken to and who have personally asked you to do it. One person who forwarded one of these mails five years ago and accidentally included her phone number still gets 50 calls a day. The problem is that these chain letters just _don’t die_.
