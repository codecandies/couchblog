[Textism’s Refer 2.1](http://www.textism.com/tools/refer/ "Textism") is out. I’m still using one of the first versions, ‘cause I was too lazy to change the templates and some database extensions I put in it. But these are now feature of Refer: _Added listing option for search queries from Google, etc._.

Via [etc.: A number of updates](http://www.fortysomething.ca/mt/etc/archives/003164.php).
