The Herald Tribune: [Cents and sensibility, the Dutch way](http://www.iht.com/articles/115991.html "IHT: Cents and sensibility, the Dutch way"):

> The Association of Dutch Retailers on Friday unveiled plans for an experiment to cut the use of one- and two-cent euro coins by rounding customers’ bills to the nearest 5-cent increment at checkout.
>
> Dutch stores estimate they will save a total of €30 million, or $34.7 million, each year in time spent counting the coins and transporting them to the bank.

I guess that will set the trend, because the dutch are not the first nation that don’t want small cent coins, in Finland also bill are rounded often. This will not only save some time, I guess, it’ll help me too, as I’m one of the guys, who always carries a ton of coins, but it’s never enough to pay something with it… which seems to be a bit strange…
