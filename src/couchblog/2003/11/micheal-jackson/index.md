[The Aardvark](http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/archives/2003/11/000313.html) says, that mentioning **Micheal Jackson** on your blog these days, would bring many hits from google. Silly that! I’ve mentioned Micheal Jackson [before](http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2002/11/is_this_micheal_jackson.php) (was this Micheal Jackson?), so there’s no need to write about him again. Especially in connection with words like “baby”, “jail” or “police”. Maybe there are other words worth mention here, but maybe that would attracked some save-my-children content filters?

Ok, for sake, here’s a related [link](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/mjmug1.html).
