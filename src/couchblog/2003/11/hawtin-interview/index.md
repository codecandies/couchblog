A [Wired Interview with Richie Hawtin](http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,61273,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2 "Wired News: Techno DJ Is Hot, Hot, Hawtin") reminds us on Hawtins great site: [m-nus.com](http://www.m-nus.com/). The short interview itself gives another hint for the digital dj-setup:

> I don’t do the regular DJ thing with a couple of turntables. I’m bringing in this specialized DJ mixer that has been completely customized…. It’s an Allen & Heath mixer, which has been completely retrofitted by my dad, who is an electrical engineer. So we added some new technologies: MIDI implementation, new knobs and buttons and dials so that a mixer which traditionally controls just the audio feeds controls two G4 laptops.

Um, there’s x-mas ahead, so that’s something I’ve got to place on my wishlist ;-)
