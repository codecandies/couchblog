Die [Asia Times](https://web.archive.org/web/20041114013320/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/DH17Ak03.html) stellt die Frage, ob der Krieg gegen den Irak nicht schon begonnen hätte. Tatsächlich ist es eine Frage der Definition. Immens zumindest ist der Truppenaufmarsch rund um den Irak:

> Since March, 12,000 US troops have been added to Kuwait (8,000) and Qatar (4,000) and 5,000 Brits to Oman, bringing the April/May total to 62,000. In late June, the Turkish foreign ministry reported heavy air traffic of US military transport planes aimed at increasing the number of US troops in southern Turkey from 7,000 to 25,000 by the end of July. Also in June, a contingent of 1,700 British Royal Marines were re-deployed from Afghanistan to Kuwait and a 250-man, highly-specialized German NBC (nuclear-biological-chemical) warfare battalion equipped with “Fuchs” (fox) armored vehicles has been in Kuwait since early this year.
