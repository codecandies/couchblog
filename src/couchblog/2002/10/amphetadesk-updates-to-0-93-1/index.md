[AmphetaDesk - New Version 0.93.1](https://web.archive.org/web/20050121175911/http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/whats_new.html "AmphetaDesk - What's New?"):

- Optional Radio Userland Listening: AmphetaDesk can now optionally parse the “coffee mug” icon that is often shown on Radio Userland produced websites. This feature is turned off by default (as it could conflict with an existing installation of Radio Userland on your machine).
- Improved Compatibility: AmphetaDesk once again works on Windows 95 and Macintosh OS 7-9.

Plus jede Menge Bugfixes.
