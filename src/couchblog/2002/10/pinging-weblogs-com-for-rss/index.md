Keith Devens has a one line [PHP Script](https://web.archive.org/web/20040703023437/http://www.keithdevens.com/weblog/?id2984 "Keith Devens .com - Weblog (entry #2984)") (using his own [Library](https://web.archive.org/web/20040703023437/http://www.keithdevens.com/software/xmlrpc)) to ping the new weblogs.com [service](https://web.archive.org/web/20040703023437/http://www.xmlrpc.com/weblogsComForRss) for RSS. Unfortunatly my [Amphetadesk](https://web.archive.org/web/20040703023437/http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/) does not seem to support the format of the weblogs.com for RSS [Feed (RSS/XML)](https://web.archive.org/web/20040703023437/http://www.weblogs.com/rssUpdates/changes.xml) but this should be fixed soon I’ll hope. From now on you can ping the service when you’re Feeds are renewed… publish to the people!
