[Jonathon Delacour: Moral dilemma](https://web.archive.org/web/20030709194937/http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000767.html "Jonathon Delacour: Moral dilemma"), not only a good and interesting read, Jonathan delivers a deep view into the mind of what I call the religious mind, which seems to be still present overseas. Just read and make your opinion.

BTW: The story feels a bit like from the script of [7th Heaven](https://web.archive.org/web/20030709194937/http://www.thewb.com/Shows/Show/0,7353,%7C%7C152,00.html) (in Germany: ‘Eine himmlische Familie’). Shiver.
