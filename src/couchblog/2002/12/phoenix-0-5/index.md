OK, I’m late again, but have to link this: [Phoenix 0.5 (Naples) released](https://web.archive.org/web/20040929103744/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/phoenix-release-notes.html "Phoenix 0.5 (Naples) Release Notes and FAQ").

Errr, what was this rumor of name to be changed? Still Phoenix isn’t it?
