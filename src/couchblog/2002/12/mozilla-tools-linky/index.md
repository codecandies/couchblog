Linky is a very simple addon to the context menu that provide you with the following:

- Opens all links in a selection in new tabs or windows
- Finds and opens link in plain text in a new tab or window
- Opens all links on page in new tabs or windows
- Open all links that appears to be linking to an image in new tabs or windows
- Shows all links that appears to be linking to an image in one new tab or window
- Open all links that appears to be linking to an image in one new tab or window

Cool tool.
