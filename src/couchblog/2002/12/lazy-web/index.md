[Ben Hammersley.com: Trackback, RDF, and the LazyWeb](https://web.archive.org/web/20040929103826/http://www.benhammersley.com/archives/003371.html "Ben Hammersley.com: Trackback, RDF, and the LazyWeb"):

> So here’s what I’d like. Movable Type blogs now automatically create trackbacks when they can. These trackbacks contain RDF, denoting the category the MT blog has that category within. MT produces RDF indexes too (in the flavour of RSS 1.0). So, what I want is a little app that takes the trackback. Follows it back to the originating site, find the RDF snippet, takes the index.rdf, and gives back all the entries within the index.rdf that are on the same subject as the trackback one.

The ideas and efforts to build up a web (as in spiderweb) across all weblogs and community sides will never come to an end… let’s look what comes out from this one.
