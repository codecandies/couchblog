I mentioned Ben Hammersleys lazy-web-idea [before](https://web.archive.org/web/20040816170857/http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2002/12/lazy_web.php) and asked, what would come of this now. What came out can be found over at [Six Log](https://web.archive.org/web/20040816170857/http://www.sixapart.com/log/2002/12/more_like_this_.shtml "Six Log: More Like This From Others"): Ben Trott made a perl script out of this. Besides that it works pretty and seems to be a cool tool as expected, the funny is that in the [sample](https://web.archive.org/web/20040816170857/http://www.sixapart.com/downloads/mltfo-output.txt) Ben (Trott) presents you can read some wellknown lines from a wellknown german weblog ;-)

**Update:** And some hours later: [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20040816170857/http://www.rayners.org/archives/000118.php) is the plugin for doing this in MT.
