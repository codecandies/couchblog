Kann ich immer noch aus dem Kopf zitieren. Schnüff, das waren noch Zeiten.… aber, ein Musical? **Über** Madness? Ich weiss nicht… dann gibt’s bestimmt bald auch folgende Follow-Ups: _Fox - The Samantha Musical, Fat Sausage - The Meat Loaf Musical, Sensible - The Capatains Musical_ und in Deutschland: _Leuchtturn - Das Nena Musical, Versammt Lang (Her) - Das Bap Musical (feat. Müsli-Män)_ usw. Nicht das ich Madness herunterreden möchte, aber man weiss ja, dass die Nachfolger qualitativ meist nicht dem Original entsprechen… ;-)
