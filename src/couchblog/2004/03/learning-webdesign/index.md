Learning Webdesign, hum? Digital Web has [a Recipe for Learning Web Design](http://www.digital-web.com/features/recipe_for_web_design.shtml "Digital Web Magazine - Features: A Recipe for Learning Web Design"), that’s a good short read to remember daily.

> It’s very important to note that, no matter how much you know, there is always more to learn. I don’t think there is any Web professional out there that will tell you they 100% “get” the Web, regardless of how long they’ve been at it. Things change too quickly and there is just too much to learn and know.

Nice to see development, as I can see me or my friends, like [Sebastian](http://verpixelt.de/), who was hired @ [Mädche&Jongens](http://mundj.de/) at last, making jumps instead of steps. Follow the young Oldenburg professionals for your special web- and design needs … ;-)
