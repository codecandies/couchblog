New service [I Like \[Beta\]](http://mercury.hjalli.com/ilike/). With a favelet/bookmarklet you can mark pages you like. The system supplies a set of pages you might also like, based on profiles and stuff. From these informations you can build lists like “pages I like”, or “I like! recommended” or “Pages that grab my attention”. The blogroll follow-up-tool, maybe. The lists can be syndicated to your blogs sidebar for instance, via javascript includes.
