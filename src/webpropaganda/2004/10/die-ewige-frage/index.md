> **Linus Torvalds:** Oh, I think it's started already, it's just slow. You don't realize just \_how\_ slow it is, unless you've been looking at Linux over the last ten years. People kind of expect it to suddenly be "good enough" and take off like a rocket, but that's not how these things work. It gets better very gradually, and people get used to it very gradually. So I look back ten years, and think about how Linux was back then, and I have to chuckle a bit. The desktop of today is a bit better than it was a year ago, but you don't \_really\_ see the differences unless you step back a lot more..
