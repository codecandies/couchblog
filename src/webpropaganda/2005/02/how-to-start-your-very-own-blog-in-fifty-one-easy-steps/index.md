Na, wenn das mal nicht ein wenig 체bertrieben ist: [How To Start Your Very Own Blog In Fifty-One Easy Steps!](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/2/7/161047/1869). Da w채re die H체rde dann doch ein wenig gross. Allerdings sind die aufgef체hrten Steps nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisen:

> 5\. Spend the next seventeen hours creating a functioning website from scratch. If using Microsoft FrontPageTM, relocate all children and elders to a safe area out of your "profanity zone".
>
> 13\. Realize in horror that you have absolutely no idea what you're going to write about.
>
> 18\. Come up with a touching yet funny childhood memory you can write about, like when you and all the other fat kids in the neighborhood used to take down the ice cream man not unlike a pack of lions ravaging a wounded gazelle.
>
> 46\. Just before you fall asleep, realize with horror you'll need to repeat steps #11 to #45 daily to keep your bragging rights about owning a blog (which, ironically, nobody reads).

Also Nummer 46 ist mein Favorit.
