[Wake Assist](http://www.dssw.co.uk/wakeassist/) solves a wake-from-sleep problem on some Macs.

1. A few seconds after your Mac wakes up Wake Assist checks for user activity.
2. If no activity has taken place since waking up, Wake Assist performs a couple of mouse clicks.
3. Finally Wake Assist returns to waiting silently for the next wake from sleep.
