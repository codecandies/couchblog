Update:

> Internet Explorer 8 takes the Web experience beyond the page and introduces a new way to seamlessly experience the power of the Web whether you are a Web developer writing to standards, or an end user discovering a new online service. This beta release is available to everyone, but is primarily for Web developers and designers to test the new tools, layout engine, and programming enhancements.
>
> When not developing your web site, you can click the Emulate IE7 button in the command bar to browse the web like you did in IE7.
