> Microformats is natively supported in HTML5, just like it was in HTML 4, because Microformats use the built-in extension mechanisms of HTML.

> We considered RDFa long and hard (in fact this is an issue that’s a hot topic right now), but at the end of the day, while some people really like it, I don’t think it strikes the right balance between power and ease of authoring. For example, it uses namespaces and prefixes, which by and large confuse authors to no end. Just recently though I proposed something of a compromise which takes some of RDFa’s better ideas and puts them into HTML 5, so hopefully that will take care of the main needs that caused people to invent RDFa. We’ll see.
