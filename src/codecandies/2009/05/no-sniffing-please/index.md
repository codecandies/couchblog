> **It is entirely possible to encounter IE8 sending the IE7 User Agent string to the server while using the IE8 Standards Mode rendering engine; conversely, you can encounter the IE8 User Agent string while rendering in IE7’s engine.**
>
> If there ever was an argument against merely sniffing the User Agent string to base your code off of, this would be it.
