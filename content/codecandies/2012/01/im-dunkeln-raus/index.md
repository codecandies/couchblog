> When we passed the subway we tried to ignore our fate there
> Of written threats on endless walls
> Unjustified crimes carried on stifled calls
> Would you walk with me now through this pouring rain
> It used to mingle with our tears then dry with the hopes
> That we left behind
> It rains even harder now.
