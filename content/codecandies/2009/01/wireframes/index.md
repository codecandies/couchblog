_Wireframing is art._

Tatsächlich. Und derzeit mein täglich Brot beinahe. Gut, dass es das [Wireframes Magazine](http://wireframes.linowski.ca/) gibt:

> Oh come on don't be shy. Do you have something to show off while documenting rich interaction, dynamic content, user flows, and web 2.0 wireframes? Please send me a sample and I will put it up. Also tell me who to credit and if you would like an optional link back.
