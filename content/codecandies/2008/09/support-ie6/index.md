Listen to the word! Dan Rubin [spricht](http://superfluousbanter.org/archives/2008/09/the-final-word-on-ie6/#more) es aus:

> There’s constant discussion about whether or not to continue support for IE6, and the only reason ever given these days in favor of supporting that browser is its market share. That market share is diminishing, and we’ve already reached the second beta of IE8, so let’s start dropping it already. Make the argument against supporting IE6, to your clients, your boss, your team—whoever needs to hear it, keep applying pressure and don’t back down.

Amen.
