Das [Google Online Security Blog berichtet](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/07/are-you-using-latest-web-browser.html) Ã¼ber die Update-Faulheit der Browsernutzer: man hat dazu auch Zahlen:

> Over the past 18 months, the study also shows, a maximum of 83.3% of Firefox users were using the latest major version of the web browser and also had all current patches installed (i.e. latest minor version). Only 56.1% and 47.6% of Opera and Internet Explorer users, respectively, were similarly utilizing fully-patched web browsers. Apple users are no better: since the public release of Safari 3, only 65.3% of users operate the latest Safari version.

Niederschmetternd.
