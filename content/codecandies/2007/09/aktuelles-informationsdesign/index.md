Elyssa von [Infotangle](http://infotangle.blogsome.com/) liefert eine hervorragende Zusammenfassung des modernen Informationsdesigns: [»Information Design for the New Web«](http://infotangle.blogsome.com/2007/04/02/information-design-for-the-new-web/). Man bringe ein wenig Zeit zur Lektüre mit.

> Principles of Information Design for the New Web
>
> - Keep it Simple - Include only necessary functionality and provide a clean efficient design.
> - Make it Social - Meet users expectations by enabling connections through social tools.
> - Offer Alternate Navigation – Reflect the Zeitgeist of the website community and embrace alternate pathways to information including utilizing visual tools.
>
> New Web Philosophies
>
> - Evolve – Today’s Website creators aren’t afraid to try new things. There is no right answer and everything doesn’t need to be figured out at the outset.
> - Be Nimble – Respond to advances in technology and changes in market needs. Be willing to abandon bad ideas
> - Be Open – Issue and API and design badges and widgets for your users – or they will design them for you.
