Interesting.

First, I consider to be a hybrid of all. I'm designing parts of our sites (more in the meaning of »making things work«), I'm programming all kinds of javascript nonsense (from web site scripting to bigger web applications and mashups), I do things in PHP, build templates in Smarty and PHPTemplate, I hate XSLT but I do it and (not that I'm proud of all things) there's nearly no HTML/CSS-Code that I didn't put my hands on or reviewed it. And as if I have spare time left, in addition I'm attending to a bunch of regular and project meetings, sometimes as Advisor, sometimes as project member, often both.

1. So do I consider myself designer or developer? None of it, I would say. This hybridical state of »doing all kinds of web techniques« isn't one or another. Maybe I need a new job description, maybe this all is too much to be good in all of it, but maybe this is what companies »on the way« to the web are looking for. Not to forget, I've learned a real named profession: »Fachinformatiker/Anwendungsentwicklung« in german, maybe translates to »not university studied IT-Professional for developing Applications« (holy shit!), but that's not what I'm actually doing. Hmmm. Ambivalence. To come to an end: I consider myself to be a »web specialist« maybe, which is a funny term, cause specializing in something that big is nonsense itself. ;)
2. What I call myself is a) Frontend-/Webdeveloper and most of the time b) »Fachinformatiker« (cause learning a reaL nameable profession is still important in germany these days, may the profession name as stupid as it is).
