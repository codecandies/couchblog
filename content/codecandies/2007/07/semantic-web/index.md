Tim Berners Lee [sagt](http://www.itworld.com/Tech/4535/070709future/index.html):

> The Semantic Web is about putting data files on the Web. It's not just a Web of documents but also of data. The Semantic Web of data would have many applications to connect together. For the first time there is a common data format for all applications, for databases and Web pages.
