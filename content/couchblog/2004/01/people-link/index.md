[PLINK - People Link](http://beta.plink.org/ "PLINK - People Link"), is a “search engine” indexing FOAF\-Files. So you can search for people at last. Let’s make a test, as usual with my name: [Nico](http://beta.plink.org/search.php?q=Nico), but with the fact in mind, that my FOAF-file is unfinished and not on the server in the moment. So what do we learn: if you wanna see [Nico Lumma](http://lumma.de), it’s ok. And something more: [Moe](http://weblog.plasticthinking.org/) \[hum, that’s completely nonsense, namely\] [Gordon](http://beta.plink.org/profile.php?id=a76134866a312dae6613b448b5ebf7f809c66330) known from [poeticgeek.net](http://www.poeticgeek.net/) has linked me in his FOAF-file, but got my [surname wrong](http://beta.plink.org/profile.php?id=8b09a65bd841c57fa42fe1b8f7dbcd994feff4b9). Pffft. ;-)

Said it before and again: it’s time for a FOAF-file now.
