I’ve recently downloaded [Style Master Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) Editor](http://westciv.com/style_master/index.html "Style Master Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) Editor") for OS X **and** Windows XP, cause the screenshots are really amazing promising another addictive prog. The demo will last for 30 days, that’s enough time to see if that’s a good buy for my iMac. And I can compare both platforms.
