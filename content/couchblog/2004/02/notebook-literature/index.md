Always nice to travel by train and have the notebook (noty! noty! very noty!) with you, at least to spend some time reading. You need some good reads? Find some good [classical literature in PDF Format here](http://www.codecuts.com/mainpage.asp?webpageid=2330). Many books, [from classical to computer books here](http://homepage.mac.com/kaotech/Free_Books.html), and last but not least the biggest source [here](http://promo.net/pg/ "Project Gutenberg").
