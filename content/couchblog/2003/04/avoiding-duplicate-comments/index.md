Since I added the notice not to click the post button several times when transmitting a comment here, the situation got a bit better, the rate of »double-posting« is going down. Surely there is a better way to avoid double commenting: [MT Extensions: Avoiding Duplicate Comments 2.0](http://www.nonplus.net/software/mt/AvoidingDuplicateComments.htm "MT Extensions: Avoiding Duplicate Comments 2.0") is a MT\-sourcehack that completly stop the doublehitters.

> When a visitor submits a comment, sometimes it takes a while for the comment page to refresh to reflect that their comment was successfully added. During this time, the user may click the »Post« button again (and again…) which causes their comment to be submitted multiple times.

> This hack modifies MovableType to simply ignore the same comment being entered multiple times for an entry. Two comments are considered the same if the comment text and the name, email address and url of the comment auther are exactly the same.
