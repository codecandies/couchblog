I couldn’t resist to registrate at [BlogShares](http://www.blogshares.com/), the virtual sharemarket for weblogs…\*gg. And for all of us MT\-Bloggers, [David Raynes](http://www.rayners.org/) has put together a [plugin: MTBlogShares (v 0.1)](http://www.rayners.org/archives/000215.php "David Raynes: MTBlogShares (v 0.1)") to display the share details for instance in your sidebar. Cool. Fast. Creapy.

By the way: feel free to click on the banner down in the sidebar and buy some of my shares!
