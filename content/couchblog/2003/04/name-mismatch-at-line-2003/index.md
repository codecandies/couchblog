The mozilla name story (we [talked about](http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2003/04/new_names.php "couchblog: new names")) is getting worse. According to [this document](http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap/branding.html "mozilla.org: branding") Thunderbird and Firebird are just codenames for the projects, not brands for the software that is developed there. At least, the product brands will be: »Mozilla Application Suite« for pre 1.4 Mozillas, after that, the names will change to »Mozilla Browser« and »Mozilla Mail«. Maybe.
