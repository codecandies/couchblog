Some new interesting MT\-Plugins are waiting to be tested:

- [MTBlogRoll](http://eekeek.org/blogs/sungo/archives/000080.html) (or in the [MT Plugin Directory](http://mt-plugins.org/archives/entry/blogroll.php)) displays a blogroll extracted of an OPML\-file, which some newsaggregator (e.g. [Amphetadesk](http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/)) can export.
- [MTBlogPings](http://www.rayners.org/archives/000225.php) (or in the [MT Plugin Directory](http://mt-plugins.org/archives/entry/blogpings.php)) displays the total count of received pings of a blog. This is a very easy one, but it will be extended in further versions.
