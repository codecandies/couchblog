[Anton Chuvakin (O’Reilly) points](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3168 "O'Reilly Network: Great Personal Infosec Site") at the great [Infosec site of Kurt Seifried](http://seifried.org/security/ "Kurt Seifried"), who serves several great articles about security (without commercial interest). There is some really interesting stuff there, such as those two articles: [Why Linux will never be as secure as OpenBSD](http://seifried.org/security/os/20011107-linux-openbsd.html) and [Why OpenBSD will never be as secure as Linux](http://seifried.org/security/os/20011107-openbsd-linux.html).
