> I blog because I am a Selfish Pig. Scratch my back a little to the left please. Ahh. That feels good. My Selfish Pig view of life was intentionally constructed in my youth because I felt confused and miserable. After a failed shopping expedition through all the existing suits of philosophies and religions, I found nothing that fit me comfortably. So I proceeded to build one myself, one that fits me perfectly using a fabric with no ends so it canâ€™t be unraveled later.
