> From Motorola, the first commercial portable cellular phone to receive FCC approval. The DynaTAC 8000X, which weighs just 28 ounces, works on the new Advanced Mobile Phone Service that’s being rolled out, and has an LED display, memory to store thirty »dialing locations,« and enough battery life for 30 minutes of talk time and eight hours of standby. Retail price: $3,995.
