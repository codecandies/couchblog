> Soon [Star Wars behind-the-scenes webcam goes live](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60271-2003May30.html) when shooting for Episode III begins in Australia. ‘The webcam will be moved every day, shooting live for 12 hours and then replaying in a loop while the cast is sleeping.’ Of course it’s only free until next week when you will have to join [StarWars.com’s newly relaunched site](http://www.starwars.com/) to view the cam as part of a package of services that includes online chats, outtakes and deleted scenes.
