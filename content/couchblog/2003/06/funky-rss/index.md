Seems like [Dave Winer](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/06/17#When:5:40:38AM "scripting news: funky") takes the recent discussions with his very special humor: so funky!

> Brent Simmons’s [RSS feed](http://inessential.com/xml/rss.xml) is totally _not_ funky. Thanks Brent. And I think it’s safe to assume that even if Brent’s software sucked up all the other software in the world, his feed would still not be funky. Postscript: Brent’s feed is so not funky that it’s even less funky than _my_ [RSS feed](http://www.scripting.com/rss.xml), which is pretty damned not funky. Maybe I’ll remove the three bits of funk in my feed. I wonder if anyone would miss them.
