[Simon Willisons](http://simon.incutio.com/ "Simon Willison") activties for a better CSS powered world [are well known](http://simon.incutio.com/categories/csstutorial/ "Simon Willison: CSS tutorial") now. The latest edition called [Fun with links](http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/05/27/funWithLinks "Simon Willison: Fun with links") is again very helpful. It shows how to make a nice menu from an <ul>-list, with many effects and such. Using an <ul>-list opens the door for MT\-User because we all know how to build a nice <ul>-list with MT-tags interactively. Together this is a powerful feature to build horizontically aligned menues in your blog.
