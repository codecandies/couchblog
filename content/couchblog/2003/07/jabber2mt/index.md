[This](http://arch.jabber.com/archives/2003/07/000023.html "Jabber Architecture: JMT: Post to MovableType from Jabber") sounds err reads to me very interesting:

> When I told Mena about this last night, she said “where’s the code?”. Fair enough. Here’s a script that allows you to hook MT up to Jabber. You’ll need your own Jabber server, since that’s the model that made sense to me, one agent per MT install, with one pseudo-user per blog.
