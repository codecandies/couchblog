One point to prove the usability of your website ist to make it suitable for screenreaders, i.e. using title- and alt-attributes for all graphical objects etc. But did you ever listen to a screenrader program reading a website? You can take a chance at [Whitelabel.org](http://www.whitelabel.org/archives/000332.html), where youâ€™ll find a MP3 example.
