Commenting in a blog using only CAPSLOCKED CHARACTERS always seems to me like someone is shouting at me. This comment to an [older story](http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2002/11/is_this_micheal_jackson.php "Couchblog: Is this Michael Jackson?") seems more like crying (hysterically) than shouting. Isnâ€™t it?
