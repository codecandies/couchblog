> This war is an atavistic response to the terror attacks launched against us. It may not be fair or rational to punish Iraq for 9/11, but at some very deep level our government and a great many citizens need a demonstration of our power and will to use it. Osama (if we got him) and the Taliban aren’t big enough trophies.

If this is real (and I guess it is) what I’m saying has to be correct too: There is no way out or around this war! It will happen, also if the UN, germany, france or the rest of the world are against it. There’s no way out. Afterwoods, will they claim ‘not guilty’ in cause of psycholical reasons?
