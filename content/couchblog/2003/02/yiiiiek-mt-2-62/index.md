Ben and Mena maybe have read my last entry and for a good joke, here is [MT 2.62](http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_02.shtml#000797 "movabletype.org: News"), which fixes a vunerability, **so if you haven’t, go and update again**. OK family Trott you’ve won this time…

**Update:** Ben asked not to supply more information about the case, so I deleted some informations. I flamed about posting such a discussion in an open forum isn’t very nice, maybe blogging about it is the same. Just go and update plz.
