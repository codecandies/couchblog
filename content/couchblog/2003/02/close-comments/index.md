One of the new feature in MT is to close comments of (older) articles, so you donâ€™t have to mantain old discussions anymore (in the cause of whatever). If you want to close comments automatically, you can use [this script](http://backlog.geeksblog.com/t/2003/02/23/000065/) from [Geeksblog](http://backlog.geeksblog.com/) (if you own Version 2.6, MySQL and PHP).
