[Noel Jackson](http://noeljackson.com/archives/000334/index.php "noeljackson.com") scripted a nice [entity converter](http://noeljackson.com/code/converter/ "noeljackson.com: entity converter"). Put code-examples in and get your displayable html-code out. Thanks for that!

**Later:** walked a bit through Noels site and found another goodie: [MTStats](http://noeljackson.com/code/mtstats/), a php script that shows your blogging activity in a chart. Cool.
