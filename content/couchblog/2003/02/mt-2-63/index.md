Just to keep it up to date (the running gag should end), [there is again a new version](http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_02.shtml#000803 "movabletype.org: News") of [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) available. If you are using 2.62 and not experiencing any problems, there is no urgent need to ugprade. the instructions say, so do I, cause there are none. Iâ€™m stuck with my MT 2.620815 now.
