OK, [Movable Type 2.6](http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_02.shtml#000782 "movabletype.org: News") is there, featuring:

- Text Formatting options.
- Support for Creative Commons Licenses.
- Adding a new category directly from the New/Edit entry screen.
- Sanitize, for cleaning up visitor-submitted data (thanks to Brad Choate).
- An <MTLink> tag.
- Enhanced options for comments: Closed, Open and None.
- Support for the metaWeblog.newMediaObject XML-RPC method.
- Support for RSD.
- PostgreSQL and SQLite database drivers.
- Improved usability of the comments form in the default templates (thanks to Jeremy Hedley).

So we have a [site redesign](http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2003/02/soon_on_a_couch_near_you.php "Couchblog Archives") \*) and [party](http://www.couchblog.de/bassreflex/archives/2003/01/party.php "Bassreflex Archives") weekend. Yohooo.

\*) **Later:** Had to change plans, Iâ€™m too tired, so no coding this weekend.
