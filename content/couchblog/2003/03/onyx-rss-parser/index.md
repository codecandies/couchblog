As [mentioned](http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2003/01/blogroll_again.php "Clouchblog: Blogroll again") before, I’m using the PHP\-RSS\-parser from [ReadingEd aka. Ed Swindelles](http://www.readinged.com/ "ReadingEd Homepage") for parsing my blogroll from [blogrolling.com](http://www.blogrolling.com) and show it here in the sidebar. Now there is a new version of this neat program, Ed reedited and renamed it to [Onyx RSS](http://www.readinged.com/onyx/rss/ "ReadingEd: Onyx RSS"), and there are some nice new features in it. Here’s my advice: try it. It has useful functions and a easy-to-use interfaces, so people with starter-capabilties in PHP can use it. And Ed supplies some nice [examples](http://www.readinged.com/onyx/rss/examples.php "ReadingEd: Onyx RSS: Examples") of Onyx usage. Cool.
