And another update today. I [flamed](http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2003/02/watn_schrott.php "couchblog: Wat'n Schrott") about the recently hyped news aggregator [Newsmonster](http://www.newsmonster.org/ "Newsmonster Homepage") some days ago. I have to confess: **they fixed every single bug** I was complaining about in a really short time. That was fast and really makes me feel ashamed. I was very angry that day I guess.

Now: it works. No more java-errors, no more homepage stealing, uninstall routine added, article index works, subcriptions work. And all this within eight days. Respect. I installed it again and will test it the next days.

Remark: these errors showed up on Windows XP. As reported on the [NM Homepage](http://www.newsmonster.org/ "Newsmonster Homepage") there are still bigger problems with Mac OS X.
