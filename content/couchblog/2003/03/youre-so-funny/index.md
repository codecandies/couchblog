Read this and keep laughing: [New York Post: Give up french whine…](http://www.nypost.com/news/worldnews/70816.htm "NYPOST.COM World News: GRAPES OF WRATH: GIVE UP FRENCH WHINE By BILL HOFFMANN")

> In the coming days, we’ll give you tips on how to live a Weasel-free life by using products made in America and in countries that support our war on terror, instead of those made in France and Germany.

This is all getting so funny. _If_ you’re a patriotic american, let me tell you: we’re laughing not at but about you. And please, give back all these mercedes-benz, porsches and vw’s to us, some people over here will be pleased to buy them, for a small fee of course. And all you NY Post-Readers: this is now the moment to burn some books… go ahead!
