I added some functionality to my blogroll (way down in the sidebar), using the RSS\-Feed from [blogrolling.com](http://www.blogrolling.com) and [this Code by PapaScott](http://www.papascott.de/2002/10/20/1938.php#001938 "PapaScott: The New Old Blogroll").

Scott uses the [Magpie RSS Parser](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) which is nice but has some clues in the documentation I didn’t understood. I couldn’t get it to work on my server. So I used another program: [RSS Parser from ReadingEd.com](http://www.readinged.com/articles/rssparser/). This one is easy to understand (fits my capabilities in PHP) and so it teached me a good lesson about parsing RSS with PHP.
