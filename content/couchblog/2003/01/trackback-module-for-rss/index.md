[Justin Klubnik](http://justin.madskills.com), Ben and Mena Trott developed a [TrackBack Module for RSS](http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/ "TrackBack Module for RSS 1.0/2.0"), so now Trackback functionality can be build into RSS Feeds.

And another BTW: While the rest of the world uses trackback and is developing more and more tools for it, it isn’t very popular over here in Germany, what means it isn’t well understood nor often used. Some blogger called it ‘the flop of the year 2002’. Maybe they miss a point there…
