Was just over there and watched the trailer for the new Tarantino-Movie: [Kill Bill](http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/kill_bill/ "Kill Bill - Teaser Trailer") for three times. Yippieyaheh, a kung-fu-woman starred by Uma Thurman. Can we get it any better? Visit the [website](http://www.kill-bill.com/ "Kill Bill") too.
