Everybody whoâ€™s still using the 1st version of Mozilla (like my grilfriend) should update to [Mozilla 1.0.2](http://www.mozilla.org/releases/stable.html "Mozilla 1.0.2"). But: Mozilla 1.0.2 contains stability and security improvements. 1.0.2 also has fixes for standards support, UI correctness and polish, performance, and site compatibility. This is not a feature release. For new features, Mozilla 1.0 users are encouraged to upgrade to Mozilla 1.2.
