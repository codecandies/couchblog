I added a new background color (the white was killing my eyes…), boxes in the menu and a few things to the site today. Unfortunately only users of the [Mozilla-Browser](http://www.mozilla.org "Mozilla") have the capability to see these nice rounding on the boxes’ borders.

Indeed, I’m again bored by my own page, but there’s no time for a bigger redesign in the moment. Wait ‘til spring…
