Substition of MTTags with grahics is a well known trick for instance to display different picture on different days. Certainly in the way you can improve your date display. [Maniacalrage](http://www.maniacalrage.net/archives/2003_01.php#000217 "maniacalrage [archives]") has put together a tutorial how this could be done and especially the display in the upper left corner of the entry looks nice to me, it is marked for the next design update of my site (which is already on the way… oh yes, I mentioned that before…).
