‘Colors in webdesign’ is one of my my favourites in the moments, though: “[Poynter.org: Color Contrast & Dimension in News Design](http://poynterextra.org/cp/index.html "Poynter.org: Color Contrast & Dimension in News Design")” pushes the plot a bit more far than I needed. But, it’s a very nice work indeed.
