This is an all-will-blog-it-item, but a must-have also: [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/ "A List Apart") returns with a new style and three new articles, for instance: [The sliding doors of CSS](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/slidingdoors/), which contains a very good introduction to styling <ul>-driven-tabbars with images. They present another step of what was started some months ago with the first list-tabs and end up in a way to style these tabs so that they can be sold to any customersite you work with. Good job.
