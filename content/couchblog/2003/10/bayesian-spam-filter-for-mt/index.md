Due to the fact that I get about 2 spams a day, I’ll test [Bayesian filter for MT](http://james.seng.cc/archives/000152.html "James Seng's blog: Bayesian filter for MT"). So from now on, I’ll train my filters (like I do with Email every day). As 2 spams a day are not too much, I guess there’s enough time to do so. And the plugin comes with a nice Interface for controlling comments and trackbacks. More on it later, when there are effects to see.
