Safari (Sven: “Safffari.”) 1.1 is out and again far from perfection, as you can see at [diveintomark](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/11/12/safari) where a new “round of CSS-hacks” is opened. I ask myself if these annoying javascript implementation bugs are away now. I’m not really sure, why a silly 1% bunch of people make so much noise: as you can see, there are bugs in that, like in every browser, but they are always complying at the servicedesk about my sites not rendering properly. Buh. ;-) On the other hand, I never heard a complain from a Konqueror User.
