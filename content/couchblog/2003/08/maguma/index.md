[Sterling Hughes](http://www.edwardbear.org/blog/ "Sterling Hughes Weblog") (known for pogramming several PHP modules) [points](http://www.edwardbear.org/blog/archives/000228.html "Sterling Hughes: PHP IDE") to the PHP IDE “[Maguma Studio](http://www.maguma.com/en/desktoptour.html "Maguma Studio Desktop Tour")”, which seems to be a very nice program. In the actual version it’s only released for Windows, but Linux and MAC OS X support is planned for the next .0 release.

I’ll give it a try later.
