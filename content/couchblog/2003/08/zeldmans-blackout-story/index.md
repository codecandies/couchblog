[Jeffrey Zeldman writes about the blackout](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0703b.shtml#twentynine "Jeffrey Zeldman Presents: The Daily Report"):

> That night and the long next day the landlord did nothing about the lack of light on the stairs. That night and the next day the doorman worked three shifts in a row. Every time an unprepared tenant needed to go upstairs, the doorman walked that tentant up with his flashlight. Up 21 flights and down. Up eight flights and down. Up 16 flights and down. That man was a hero, although he did not make The Daily News or CNN.
