What I really like about [Dawns](http://a.lifeuncommon.org/ "a . l i f e u n c o m m o n . org") photos is, besides their technical quality, that she has the look to find the _photo situations_. When Dawn makes a visit in the zoo, the animals seem to pose for her! And if she looks to the sky, thereâ€™s another great click waiting. [Just have a look.](http://a.lifeuncommon.org/history/200308/#1754 "a . l i f e u n c o m m o n . org")
