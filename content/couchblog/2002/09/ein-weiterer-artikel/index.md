[St. Petersburg Times: Blog bonanza](http://www.sptimes.com/2002/09/09/Technology/Blog_bonanza.shtml)

> Blogs can be personal journals, such as Thompson’s. Or they can be someone’s opinions on the news of the day. They can be used for business (including sharing notes from meetings written as they happen). Groups with a common interest, such as computer geeks or journalists or fans of particular TV shows, can share information through blogs.
