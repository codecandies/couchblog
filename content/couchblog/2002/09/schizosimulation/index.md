[NPR : The Sights and Sounds of Schizophrenia](http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/aug/schizophrenia/index.html):

> Janssen Pharmaceutica, a company that makes a drug treatment for schizophrenia, has created a multimedia simulation that it says lets a participant see the world through the eyes and ears of a person with schizophrenic illness. Janssen created the simulation as an education tool for doctors and others who want a more visceral understanding of the illness.
