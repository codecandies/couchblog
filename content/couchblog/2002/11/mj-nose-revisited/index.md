> The MJ Morning Show (WFLZ 93.3 Tampa, Z107.7 St. Louis, WMAX 105.3 Atlanta, B101 Columbus, GA) has secured one of Michael Jackson’s prosthetic noses. This fake nose was found wrapped in a surgical mask in a dumpster behind the “Adlon Hotel,” in Berlin, Germany. This is the same hotel where Jacko shocked the world by dangling his nine month-old infant from the 4th floor balcony. A German Internet listener of our show rummaged through the dumpster and found this rare, one-of-a-kind, extremely collectible “King of Pop” Schnoz. This is a MUST HAVE for any serious collector. Buyer pays all shipping and insurance costs.
