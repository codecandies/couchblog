Wanna learn something about how to use `<iframe>`s? [Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20030620213450/http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/html/definitive/chap11/3/ "Frames - Part 3 from Chapter 11 of HTML & XHTML: The Definitive Guide (1/4) - WebReference.com [en-us]") you can read for free some O’Reilly content about that. But: you’ll probably shy away from them for most of your web pages (at least until most browsers become fully standards-compliant).
