Ladies, please change your _bookmarklet_!

> Chances are you’ve never noticed it, but every time you use your bookmarklet to post in Mozilla, it protests by way of the JavaScript Console about “”Deprecated method document.getSelection() called. Please use window.getSelection() instead.” However, now that diveintomark.org is triggering Mozilla’s “so strict it barely works” mode, you get “Error: d.getSelection is not a function” and no popup window.
