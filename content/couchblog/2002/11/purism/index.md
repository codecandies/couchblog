[HTML is not an acronym…](https://web.archive.org/web/20030620213815/http://www.saila.com/usage/acronym/ "... is not an acronym... - saila.com") but an abbreviation. Did you know that? Acronyms can be spoken like SOAP or MAC, abbreviations are made the same way (first-letter combinations of several words) but have to be spelled-out, like HTML or CSS.

Wonder, if IE is an abbreviation (spell it I…ihhhhhh!) or an acronym (only ihhhhhhhhhhhhhh!)?
