After a well earned but short blogholiday [Mark Pilgrim](https://web.archive.org/web/20030521205554/http://diveintomark.org/ "Dive Into Mark [english]") is back on blog today with an interesting new [thing](https://web.archive.org/web/20030521205554/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/11/20.html#new_reading "Dive Into Mark: New Reading [english]"): [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20030521205554/http://diveintomark.org/newdoor/ "Dive Into Mark: New Door [english]") you can type your blogs adress and get some hints, which blogs or sites you maybe should read. These hints are checked out in a _google-neighbourhood-like_ mannor, using the well known [Blogging Ecosystem](https://web.archive.org/web/20030521205554/http://www.myelin.co.nz/ecosystem/ "blogging | ecosystem [english]").

I tried it (sure I did), and found another 10 or 12 interesting links that I added to my blogroll or (if it worked) to my ampheta-subscription-list. Marks tools is great (as far as you like someone or something advising you some readings): you can mark sites you’re already reading (and it gives you another try) or you’re not interested in. Cool tool. Try it.
