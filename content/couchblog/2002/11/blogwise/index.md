…a new site bringing you a collection of categorised blogs from around the world. Whatever your taste, interest and culture - there’s bound to be a blog out there written by a person just like you. If not, then why not start one yourself!
Sounds like another nice tool to list and search weblogs. Hits [blogdex](https://web.archive.org/web/20030505204835/http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/) high today, so go there and make your entry.
