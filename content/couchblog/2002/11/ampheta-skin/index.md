[Papa Scott](https://web.archive.org/web/20030706113208/http://www.papascott.de/ "Papa Scott: Homepage [en-us]"), who recently has moved to a [new virtual home](https://web.archive.org/web/20030706113208/http://www.papascott.de/index.php?p=1981&more=1&c=1 "Papa Scott: New Home [en-us]"), [found](https://web.archive.org/web/20030706113208/http://www.papascott.de/index.php?p=1982&more=1&c=1 "Papa Scott: RSS Uproar [en-us]") a very nice and suitable and new [skin](https://web.archive.org/web/20030706113208/http://zymm.com/raster/code/amphetaskin.html "Raster web: Ampheta Desk Skin [en-us]") for my favourite news-aggregator [Amphetadesk](https://web.archive.org/web/20030706113208/http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/ "Disobey: Amphetadesk [en-us]"), which kills the odd table-design of the standard template to css-design and gives the feedlist (and everything else) a perfect new look. Cool.
