[Horst Prillinger](https://web.archive.org/web/20030718183701/http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/ "The Aardvark Speaks") (or better his RSS\-Feed: [Horst Prillingers MediaWatch](https://web.archive.org/web/20030718183701/http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/categories/mediawatch/rss.xml "RSS-Feed")) reminded me about this interesting site: [The Political Compass](https://web.archive.org/web/20030718183701/http://www.digitalronin.f2s.com/politicalcompass/index.html "The Political Compass [english]"). I passed this test, which can give you hints of your positioning in political contexts, about half a year before but (as this was in my old lost blog) I can’t find it anymore, so I did [again](https://web.archive.org/web/20030718183701/http://www.digitalronin.f2s.com/politicalcompass/questionnaire.pl?page=printable_graph&X=-5.62&Y=-7.23 "Analysis").

As far as I can say: there were no changes, still standing in the left corner. What I can state is: unemployment, going back to school and the drastic political situation in germany didn’t changed my mind. Maybe that’s another form of conservatism, which is not displayed by this test.![flag-english.png](images/flag-english.png)
