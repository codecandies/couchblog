![Never mind…](/img/couchblog/pistols.jpg)

Today 25 years before, the one and only Sex Pistols studio album [Never Mind The Bollocks](https://web.archive.org/web/20040904174557/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2002/10/28/120646.php "Blogcritics: Never Mind the Bollocks Turns Twenty-Five") was released. Wow. These were the days. Myself was eight and bought the album five years later… btw: a question left: who killed [bambie](https://web.archive.org/web/20040904174557/http://www.btinternet.com/~digital.wallpapers/great_rock_n_roll_swindle.htm)? And what the hell happened to ‘this is not a love song’ public image limited [Johnny Rotten](https://web.archive.org/web/20040904174557/http://www.john-lydon.com/)? Coming soon? Punk ruled, yes it did.
