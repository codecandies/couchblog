I mentioned it before, [Papa Scott](https://web.archive.org/web/20040529063647/http://www.papascott.de/) helped me out by programming a little perlscript to reimport my lost entries, or better to make an MT\-importfile out of the static backuped pages. And guess what: it worked like a charm. So I now have imported the lost content of november and most of october (there are some articles left but I’m too lazy now).

What did I learn from all this mess:

- never lose your database - **make backups** it’s pretty easy!
- if you ask for help - help is given - so go and help others if you can
- writing programs is not that hard - do more for that - school will never give you that view on programs that other people’s practice will do
- **sit down and learn those f\*\*\*ing regular expressions, they’re needed everywhere**

Scott, I really really thank you!
