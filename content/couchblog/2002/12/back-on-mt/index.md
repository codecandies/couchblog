Guess [who](https://web.archive.org/web/20040929103612/http://www.papascott.de/2002/12/21/2043.php "Backwards Is Forwards")’s back on Movable Type…(temporary?)

This nice guy is helping me solving the reimporting-the-lost-entries-problem back into the blog… in real: he’s doing it for me cause I’m far too stupid to handle it myself. Hope I can give something back for that, someday.
