OK. Another stage of getting the pages on duty again: If anybody requests the index-page of former couchblog ([http://www.couchblog.de/nico/index.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20040929103555/http://www.couchblog.de/nico/index.php)) he, she, it will be redirected on this page. When I have the archives back to work, same will happen by rewriting the URLs…

**Hi folks, hello again**, so the couch is not that sick anymore… but also not really out of the hospital again. For instance: there seems to be a problem with the language, all my German is gone.
