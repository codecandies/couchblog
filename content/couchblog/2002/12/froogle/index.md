> Froogle is a new service from Google that makes it easy to find information about products for sale online. By focusing entirely on product search, Froogle applies the power of Googleâ€™s search technology to a very specific task: locating stores that sell the item you want to find and pointing you directly to the place where you can make a purchase.
