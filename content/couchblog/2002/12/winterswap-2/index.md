With the typical delay I sent out the three CDs today, so they should reach Munich, Cologne and Berlin tomorrow. I sent the CDs without a letter or anything (I didn’t managed that in time), and without cover too, but I will supply Coverpicture and Playlist here, tomorrow I guess. The CD got a compilation of music I listen to this time, like ambient, trip hop, dub and tunes like that, nearly without vocals, so nothing to sind alogn with and extremely nothing from the radio heavy rotations. Hope this fits also to other people not just to me.

Bytheway: no CD reach my snailmailbox yet.

**Update:** When I came back from school there were two disks in the box! Listening to them in the moment… cool.
