Yes, we learn UML at school and surely you can use it for your PHP\-Proggies too.

Read more about it at [phppatterns()](https://web.archive.org/web/20040925030828/http://www.phppatterns.com/index.php/article/view/15/1/1 ":: phpPatterns() - PHP and UML Class Diagrams").

I found a nice printable _poster_ about UML [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20040925030828/http://www.rational.com/uml/resources/quick/plainposter.jsp?SMSESSION=NO "rational.com: UML").
