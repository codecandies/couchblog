You enjoy the social element of smoking. You will find that you are tempted to smoke when those around you do – not just because it reminds you of cigarettes, but because of the subliminal bonding than many smokers feel when they have a cigarette together.

Try and avoid the pub in the first couple of weeks of giving up, and when you do go ask your friends not to offer you a cigarette.

If you miss the opportunity that cigarette breaks give you to chat with your colleagues, invite them to go for a walk at lunch.

_First thing in the morning_
Clean your teeth and think of the taste of stale cigarettes

_Work breaks_
Go for a quick walk outside if you can. Or sip slowly on a glass of water

_Lunchtime_
Go somewhere or eat something different. Do some exercise

_On the way to work_
Take a different route

_After finishing a meal_
Go and clean your teeth, then do something – even if it’s the washing up!

_Coffee_
Try a fruit tea or water

_Alcohol_
Change your usual drink

_Pub/party_
Avoid for the first couple of weeks if you can – watch videos, go to the cinema, go to a no-smoking restaurant

_Reading_
Have a pen or pencil to hand to fiddle with and try chewing gum

_In the car_
Have your car cleaned inside, empty out the ashtrays, and get an air freshener. It’ll put you off the idea of polluting it with cigarette smoke

_On the train_
Go in the no-smoking carriage

_Waiting for a bus/train_
Keep a book or newspaper on you and read it
