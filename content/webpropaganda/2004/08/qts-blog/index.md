> I had to delete some of the entries because my lawyer told me it wasn’t wise to call a kid negatively influenced by PULP FICTION a “dumbass,” and then create a “stupid rant with way too many fucks in it for your own good.”
> I apologize to those who read what I said yesterday, but I was a bit drunk in the evening. That’s what happens I guess. It wasn’t wise at all to post some of the bullshit I posted. No offense meant to anyone.
