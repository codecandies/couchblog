[The unspoken rules of graphic design.](http://ad-rag.com/120533.php), hier ein paar Favoriten:

> 4\. Promises made by the sales staff have no basis in reality.
> 15\. If three designs are shown to a client, your least favorite will be chosen or any combination of worst components of each.
> 18\. Clients don't have their company logo in a usable print ready format so don't bother asking.

Alles wahr und nachgewiesen. Made my day.
