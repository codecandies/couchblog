Just listening:

> Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river<br>
You can hear the boats go by<br>
You can spend the night beside her<br>
And you know that she's half crazy<br>
But that's why you want to be there<br>
And she feeds you tea and oranges<br>
That come all the way from China<br>
And just when you mean to tell her<br>
That you have no love to give her<br>
Then she gets you on her wavelength<br>
And she lets the river answer<br>
That you've always been her lover<br>
And you want to travel with her<br>
And you want to travel blind<br>
And you know that she will trust you<br>
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.
— Leonard Cohen „Suzanne“
